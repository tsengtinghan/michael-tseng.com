      <p>I grew up in Hsinchu, Taiwan, a city where the wind never stops blowing. The thriving semiconductor industry there inspired me to pursue a path in STEM, so I picked up C++ upon entering high school. I later became interested in machine learning and started working on side projects and doing computer vision research in local university. Besides writing code, I sometimes write prose and poetry in Chinese.</p>
