        I grew up in Hsinchu, Taiwan, a city where the wind never stops blowing.
        The thriving semiconductor industry there inspired me to pursue a path
        in STEM, so I picked up C++ upon entering high school. I later became
        interested in machine learning and started working on side projects and
        doing computer vision research in local university. After reading Paul Graham's 
        essays, I became fascinated by tech startups and moved to sf to learn more about them.
        Today, I'm a student and hack on side projects on nights & weekends.
