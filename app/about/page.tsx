          @ ðŸŒ‰ I love startups!
          <br /> currently learning web dev and ai to build something useful
        </p>
        <p>
          I grew up in Hsinchu, Taiwan, a city where the wind never stops
          blowing. The thriving semiconductor industry there inspired me to
          pursue a path in STEM, so I picked up C++ upon entering high school. I
          later became interested in machine learning and started working on
          side projects and doing computer vision research at a local
          university. After reading Paul Graham&apos;s essays, I became
          fascinated by tech startups and moved to SF to learn more about them.
          Today, I&apos;m a student and hack on side projects on nights &amp;
          weekends.
