        I grew up in Hsinchu, Taiwan, a city where the wind never stops blowing.
        The thriving semiconductor industry there inspired me to pursue a path
        in STEM, so I picked up C++ upon entering high school. I later became
        interested in machine learning and started working on side projects and
        doing computer vision research in local university. Besides writing
        code, I sometimes write prose and poetry in Chinese.
