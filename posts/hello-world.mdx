This is a paragraph. You can **bold** text or _italicize_ text.

You can create lists:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Or ordered lists:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

You can also create [links](https://github.com).

And include inline `code`.

Or block code:

```javascript
console.log('Hello, world!');
```

this is a very dense text so that I can make sure the spacing isn't too bad
